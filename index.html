                <p>
                    2048 is a single-player sliding tile puzzle video game
                    written by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli and
                    published on GitHub. The objective of the game is to slide
                    numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile
                    with the number 2048; however, one can continue to play the
                    game after reaching the goal, creating tiles with larger
                    numbers. It was originally written in JavaScript and CSS
                    over a weekend, and released on 9 March 2014 as free and
                    open-source software subject to the MIT License. Versions
                    for iOS and Android followed in May 2014.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2048 was intended to be an improved version of two other
                    games, both of which were clones of the iOS game Threes
                    released a month earlier. Cirulli himself described 2048 as
                    being "conceptually similar" to Threes. The release of 2048
                    resulted in the rapid appearance of many similar games, akin
                    to the flood of Flappy Bird variations from 2013. The game
                    received generally positive reviews from critics, with it
                    being described as "viral" and "addictive".

                    <h4>1. Take It Slow</h4>
                    <p>
                        2048 is so easy to play, you might get into the habit of
                        tearing through games without even really paying
                        attention to what you're doing. That's not a good idea.
                        Take your time - there's no penalty for thinking your
                        moves through after all. Also, try to predict where new
                        blocks might come in and how you could deploy them.
                        Something like playing chess
                    </p>
                    <h4>2. Work The Corners</h4>
                    <p>
                        In order to win the game you should have a specific
                        strategy. If you do not have one, you will most probaly
                        not reach furthr than 512. So, a good strategy is to
                        always keep your hiest value tile at one of the corners.
                        Just chooose one corner and direct all your tiles there.
                        It is not as easy as it sounds, but you can master it
                        quickly. In order to stop the highest value tile to
                        leave "the king's place", try to pack tiles around it.
                        Preferably, they should be the other biggest tiles.
                        Master this simple strategy and you will soon reach 1024
                        and even win the 2048 Game!

                        How to make the highest valued tile in the right bottom
                        corner and not to move it?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Once you have placed your highest tile value is in the
                        right bottom corner, do not move it. To make sure it is
                        not moved, you have to make the last row always filled
                        by pushing the down arrow so that the use of LEFT and
                        Right Arrow would not move the highest valued tile.
                        Basically, this is the most important cheat for 2048
                        Game - keep the highest tile in the corner and do not
                        move it.
